# Library written in Go to create (h)ledger files 

This library consists of two components:

1. Parsers for various input formats:
    - CSV files created by acqbanking-cli listtrans
    - CSV files of the Landesbank Berlin (Amazon.de Visa card) 
    - JSON files of the N26 online banking (you could grab them in the inspector)
2. Types and Functions to render hledger files.

Currently not public is the functionality to convert from the parser transactions to the hledger transactions, but the rules for that are rather personal anyway.
